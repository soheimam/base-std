# Currency Validation

How the `B20Stablecoin` variant constrains its `currency` field at creation, and why the chosen filter is scoped narrower than "stablecoin" colloquially suggests.

## Problem

The `B20Stablecoin` variant declares an immutable `currency` identifier at creation. Without a constraint on what issuers can pass:

- Two issuers might use `"USD"` and `"usd"` for the same currency, breaking any consumer that groups by the field.
- An issuer might pass their token's symbol (`"USDC"`) instead of a currency code.
- Tokens claiming non-currency assets (gold, crypto, governance tokens) would all coexist under the same variant, polluting any tooling that categorizes by `currency()`.

The factory needs a deterministic, machine-readable filter rather than a free-form string.

## Solution

Validate `currency` at creation against a hardcoded allowlist of active **ISO 4217 alphabetic codes** for circulating national fiat currencies, implemented in [`test/lib/ISO4217.sol`](../../../test/lib/ISO4217.sol). Anything off the list reverts with `ITokenFactory.InvalidCurrency(code)` carrying the offending string verbatim.

Scope aligns with **MiCA E-Money Tokens** and **MAS Single-Currency Stablecoins** — narrower than the broader **FSB** (Financial Stability Board) and **BIS** (Bank for International Settlements) definition that includes commodities, baskets, and crypto pegs.

Key properties:

- Set at creation by the factory; immutable thereafter.
- Self-declared — the filter gates format and membership, not truthfulness.
- Any consumer using `currency()` for authorization or routing MUST add its own issuer/contract allowlist on top.

## Specification

| Category | Status | Description | Codes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| G10 + SGD | Included | Most-traded reserve currencies; MAS-anchored set | USD, EUR, JPY, GBP, AUD, NZD, CAD, CHF, NOK, SEK, SGD |
| Multi-country X-prefix fiat | Included | Real circulating fiat issued by supranational / multi-jurisdiction central banks (BCEAO, BEAC, ECCB, IEOM, CBCS) | XOF, XAF, XCD, XCG, XPF |
| Precious metals | Excluded | Commodities, not means of payment — commodity-backed tokens belong on `B20Asset` | XAU, XAG, XPT, XPD |
| European composite units | Excluded | Defunct supranational accounting units retained for historical reconciliation | XBA, XBB, XBC, XBD |
| Other supranational synthetics | Excluded | Reserve assets and regional units of account, not circulating currencies | XDR, XSU, XUA |
| Sentinels | Excluded | Reserved markers ("no currency" / test code), not currencies | XXX, XTS |
| Funds codes / indexing units | Excluded | Inflation-indexing devices, complementary currencies, and forex settlement conventions — not things one can hold or settle in | BOV, CHE, CHW, CLF, COU, MXV, USN, UYI, UYW |

- Crypto tickers and arbitrary strings are rejected by virtue of being off the ISO 4217 active list (no explicit entry needed).
- Per-entry rationale for each blocklist code lives inline in `ISO4217.excludedAt`.
- Any future Rust precompile implementation must mirror this allowlist and blocklist exactly.

## Risks and mitigations

| Concern | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Commodity-backed tokens marketed as stablecoins (PAXG, XAUT, AABBG) will not be admitted here | These are structurally claims on a vault — assets-shaped instruments. They belong on the `B20Asset` variant. |
| Crypto-collateralized stablecoins (DAI, LUSD, crvUSD) appear to be excluded | They fit this variant fine. The backing mechanism (custodial reserves, on-chain collateral, T-bills) is irrelevant to `currency()`; what matters is the peg target. If a token pegs to USD, declare `"USD"`. |
| Basket-pegged tokens (historically Libra/Diem) and algorithmic non-pegged stable assets (Ampleforth, historically Terra UST) have no current B-20 home | Accepted trade-off. A future basket / ART variant or use of the `B20` Default variant with custom monetary policy would be the path, not relaxation of this variant. |
| The variant name "Stablecoin" carries broader industry connotations than its admitted set | Anchored in regulatory precedent — MiCA EMT, MAS SCS, and US payment-stablecoin legislative proposals all draw the same line. |
| The allowlist is self-declared, not a trust signal — an issuer can declare `currency = "USD"` without backing reserves | The factory enforces format and membership only. Any protocol consuming `currency()` for an authorization or routing decision MUST layer its own issuer/contract allowlist on top. The standardized identifier is what those consumer-side allowlists organize around, not a substitute for them. |
| Adding or removing an ISO 4217 code requires a contract change | Real but rare — ISO 4217 registrations happen on the order of once per year. Both the Solidity reference and any Rust precompile implementation must be updated in lockstep when changes do occur. |

## Alternatives considered

| Option | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **No validation**<br>Accept any non-empty<br>string for `currency` | • Simplest impl<br>• Zero maintenance<br>• Max issuer flexibility | • Typos (`"usd"`, `"USDC"`) pollute value space<br>• No on-chain categorization<br>• Admits arbitrary strings |
| **Format-only check**<br>Length 3 + uppercase<br>ASCII; no allowlist | • Cheap<br>• No allowlist to maintain<br>• Catches obvious garbage | • Admits `"ZZZ"`, `"BTC"`, `"ETH"`, etc.<br>• No semantic gate |
| **Full ISO 4217 active list**<br>Every alphabetic code,<br>incl. X-prefix metals,<br>supranational synthetics,<br>funds codes<br>(TIP-20 broad-scope<br>precedent) | • Matches the official standard literally<br>• Broadest legitimate value space<br>• Familiar to FX-adjacent tooling | • Includes commodities (belong on `B20Asset`)<br>• Includes funds codes (CLF, USN — not holdable)<br>• Breaks regulatory alignment with MiCA EMT / MAS SCS |
| **Narrow ISO 4217 fiat allowlist** *(chosen)*<br>Circulating national<br>fiat only;<br>MiCA EMT / MAS SCS<br>aligned | • Standardized value space<br>• Rejects typos at creation<br>• Regulatory-category alignment<br>• Commodities pushed to `B20Asset` | • Requires allowlist maintenance (~1/year)<br>• ISO 4217 updates need lockstep Rust impl change |

#### Recent withdrawals — accepted for backwards compatibility

The codes below have been formally withdrawn from ISO 4217 but remain on our allowlist while supply is still circulating. They will be removed in a future pass once circulation has drained; the official references are listed here so we can revisit the decision against a known anchor.

- **BGN** — withdrawn 2026-01-01 per Amendment 180; Bulgaria joined the eurozone at the fixed rate `EUR 1 = BGN 1.95583`. [Amendment 180 PDF](https://www.six-group.com/dam/download/financial-information/data-center/iso-currrency/amendments/dl-currency-iso-amendment-180.pdf)
- **ANG** — withdrawn 2025-03-31; replaced by `XCG` (Caribbean Guilder) under the Centrale Bank van Curaçao en Sint Maarten (CBCS). Both codes are currently accepted (`XCG` as a new active code, `ANG` as a backwards-compat carry-over).
