/// @dev    Bits are append-only across protocol versions. Once a bit's meaning

///         new higher-numbered bits. Default-token bits live in 0..15;
///         variants (Security 16..23, Stablecoin 24..31) define additional
///         bits in their own ranges to avoid collisions.
///
///         Granular pause control (which operations can be paused while the
///         token is in a partial-pause state) is governed by `PauseVectors`,
///         not by capability bits. A token whose `PAUSABLE` capability is
///         unset cannot be paused at all; a token whose `PAUSABLE` is set
///         can be paused on any combination of vectors. Capability bits
///         govern whether a function exists at all; pause vectors govern
///         which existing functions are temporarily halted.

    // simply not exist in the protocol surface, OR because the desired
    // guarantee can be expressed using existing primitives without a
    // dedicated bit:
    //   - MINTABLE: removed. Tokens that want "fixed supply forever"
    //     achieve it by setting `supplyCap == initialSupply` at creation
    //     with `CAP_MUTABLE` unset; `mint` then always reverts with
    //     `SupplyCapExceeded`. Tokens that want "no minting right now
    //     but maybe later" simply leave `MINT_ROLE` ungranted.
    //   - BURNABLE: burn is unconditionally available; tokens that don't
    //     want burns simply never grant BURN_ROLE. Per the PRD, there is
    //     no irreversible-disable opt-out for burn at the protocol level.
    //   - BURN_BLOCKED: force-burn from policy-blocked addresses is not
    //     in the Default surface at all; sanctions seizure is a
    //     periphery / variant concern.
    //   - ADMIN_MUTABLE: role management is always available per the
    //     OZ AccessControl pattern adopted in this draft.
    //   - POLICY_MUTABLE: admin can always swap the transfer policy ID
    //     (the policy itself can also evolve via its own admin in the
    //     registry).
    //   - URI_MUTABLE: contract URI updates are always available to
    //     admin; an issuer that wants a fixed URI simply never updates it.
