/// @dev    Sibling of `B20AssetBatchBurnTest` (happy path) and
///         `B20AssetBatchBurnRevertOrderTest` (check-order). This file
///         covers the precompile-storage checkpoint integration: when an
///         element past index 0 reverts, the per-element debits from the
///         earlier successful iterations must be rolled back.
///
///         Mock mode gets this for free from revm's journaled storage.
///         The signal is in fork mode against the real Rust precompile,
///         where any break in the `precompile-storage` journal hookup
///         would leave the earlier debits persisted across the revert.
///         Companion to BOP-176 (Rust-side unit tests).
